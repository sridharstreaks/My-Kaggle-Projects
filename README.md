- 👋 Hi, I’m @sridharstreaks
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis/Data Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Creating portfolio Projects
- 📫 How to reach me, I'm available on kaggle,linkedin,instagram with the same username.

This is a repo of a list of my Data Analysis notebooks from Kaggle. I've categorized the notebooks into other repositories for clutter-free viewing. Check out all my work on Kaggle. Link in my profile.
!!! Live Plotly plots aren't correctly supported in Git Hub. So, I'd like everyone to look at them directly on my kaggle Page!!
